## ES6

ECMAScript is a stanDardized version of JS.

It has backward compatibility, able to run in new versions.

- Let and const are blocked scoped variables.

Block scope refers to the scope of variables within a pair of curly braces {} such as within loops, conditionals and functions.

- Before ES6, JavaScript only had function scopes and global scope which led to issues like variable hoisting.

- Variables declared with `let` are only accessible within the block they are defined.

- unlike var, let declarations are not hoisted.

- `const` allows declaration of variables that are block scoped but are read-only.

- value of `const` cannot be changed after assignment.

Variables declared with the `const` must be initialized, those with `'let` can go uninitialized.
